CHANGELOG
=========

4.22.0
-----
* Updated bundle directory structure to recommended file structure as described in https://symfony.com/doc/7.0/bundles/best_practices.html.

  It might be necessary to reinstall the assets:
  ```bash
    bin/console assets:install
  ```

4.21.0
-----
* Added bundle configuration options `nelmio_api_doc.cache.pool` and `nelmio_api_doc.cache.item_id`.
  ```yml
  nelmio_api_doc:
      cache:
          pool: app.cache
          item_id: nelmio_api_doc.docs
  ```
  
4.20.0
-----
* Added Redocly as an alternative to Swagger UI. https://github.com/Redocly/redoc.
* Added support for describing dictionary types in OpenAPI 3.0.

4.0.0
-----
* Added support of OpenAPI 3.0. The internals were completely reworked and this version introduces BC breaks.

3.7.0
-----

* Added `@SerializedName` annotation support and name converters when using Symfony >= 4.2.
* Removed pattern added from the Expression Violation message.
* Added FOSRestBundle 3.x support
* Added `@SWG` annotations support at methods level in models

3.3.0
-----

* Usage of Google Fonts was removed. System fonts `serif` / `sans` will be used instead.
  This can lead to a different look on different operating systems.
  You can [re-add Google Fonts again manually by overriding the template](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/NelmioApiDocBundle/faq.html#re-add-google-fonts).

* The Twig template for the Swagger UI now contains blocks to make it easier to overwrite certain parts.
  See the [official documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/NelmioApiDocBundle/customization.html) how to do this.

3.2.0 (2018-03-24)
------------------

  /**
   * For an individual object:

   */
  ```
